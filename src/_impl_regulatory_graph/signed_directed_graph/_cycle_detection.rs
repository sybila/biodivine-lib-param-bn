           The following algorithm uses dynamic programming to compute a table which specifies
           for each (viable) variable-parity combination the shortest simple path towards the
           pivot. Based on this shortest path, we can decide if there is an appropriate parity
           cycle from pivot or not.

           The table is computed bottom-up, starting from direct predecessors. In each "main"
           iteration, we check if a cycle is possible and terminate early if a cycle is found.

           **Note that this is a tricky problem to solve exactly using pure DFS/BFS, even with
           some clever memoization tricks. In particular, one has to properly save the tree of
           shortest paths and at the same time ensure that these are indeed only simple paths.
           If you ever modify this, test carefully! (random networks with 1000+ nodes seem to
           be a good place to start)**

           **Also note that you will be tempted to cut off a path if a shorter one is known.
           This is not correct! There may be a very short path that goes to pivot but cannot be
           used because we need the result to be a simple path. Instead, you probably really
           need to keep all paths running until they either reach pivot or stop being simple.**

           The use of FxHash is not super critical, but it helps if cycles are computed very
           often (e.g. in FVS detection).
