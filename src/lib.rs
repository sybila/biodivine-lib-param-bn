//! A library for analysis of Boolean networks. As of now, the library supports:
//!  - Regulatory graphs with monotonicity and observability constraints.
//!  - Boolean networks, possibly with partially unknown and parametrised update functions.
//!  - Full SBML-qual support for import/export as well as custom string format `.aeon`.
//!  - Fully symbolic asynchronous state-space generator using BDDs (great overall performance).
//!  - Semi-symbolic state-space generator, using BDDs used only for the network parameters
//! (allows state-level parallelism for smaller networks).
//!
//! For a quick introduction to Boolean networks and their symbolic manipulation, you can
//! check out our [tutorial module](./tutorial/index.html).

/// Annotations are "meta" objects that can be declared as part of AEON models to add additional
/// properties that are not directly recognized by the main AEON toolbox.
///
/// Annotations are comments which start with `#!`. After the `#!` "preamble", each annotation
/// can contains a "path prefix" with path segments separated using `:` (path segments can be
/// surrounded by white space that is automatically trimmed). Based on these path
/// segments, the parser will create an annotation tree. If there are multiple annotations with
/// the same path, their values are concatenated using newlines.
///
/// For example, annotations can be used to describe model layout:
///
/// ```text
/// #! layout : var_1 : 10,20
/// #! layout : var_2 : 14,-3
/// ```
///
/// Another usage for annotations are extra properties enforced on the model behaviour, for
/// example through CTL:
/// ```test
/// #! property : AG (problem => AF apoptosis)
/// ```
///

/// ```text
/// #! name: My Awesome Model
/// #! description: This model describes ...
/// #! description:var_1: This variable describes ...
/// ```
///
/// You can use "empty" path (e.g. `#! is_multivalued`), and you can use an empty annotation
/// value with a non-empty path (e.g. `#!is_multivalued:var_1:`). Though this is not particularly
/// encouraged: it is better to just have `var_1` as the annotation value if you can do that.
/// An exception to this may be a case where `is_multivalued:var_1:` has an "optional" value and
/// you want to express that while the "key" is provided, but the "value" is missing. Similarly, for
/// the sake of completeness, it is technically allowed to use empty path names (e.g. `a::b:value`
/// translates to `["a", "", "b"] = "value"`), but it is discouraged.
///
/// Note that the path segments should only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores,
/// but can be escaped using backticks (`` ` ``; other backticks in path segments are not allowed).
/// Similarly, annotation values cannot contain colons (path segment separators) or backticks,
/// unless escaped with `` #`ACTUAL_STRING`# ``. You can also use escaping if you wish to
/// retain whitespace around annotation values. As mentioned, multi-line values can be split
/// into multiple annotation comments.
