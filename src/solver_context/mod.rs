//! Solver context provides a way of interfacing between `lib-param-bn` and the Z3 SMT prover.
//!
//! In particular, it provides a canonical relationship between the basic constructs of the
//! parametrized Boolean networks and their representation in Z3 syntax. The user can then use
//! this interface to build algorithms, such as the ones we provide for computation of fixed
//! points and trap spaces.
