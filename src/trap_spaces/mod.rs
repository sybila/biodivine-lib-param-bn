/// This object is a special extension of [SymbolicContext] which (aside from states and functions)
/// allows representing network subspaces (see also [crate::Space]).
///
/// The representation uses the "extra state variables" supported by [SymbolicContext]. For each
/// network variable `x`, [SymbolicSpaceContext] adds two extra symbolic variables which we
/// refer to as `x_T` and `x_F`. These then encode individual spaces such that `(1,0) = 1`,
/// `(0,1) = 0` and `(1,1) = *`. Value `(0,0)` is invalid in this encoding.
/// [SymbolicSpaceContext] should document how the `(0,0)` is treated by each method (i.e. if
/// the result discards invalid values, or if they need to be excluded later).
///
/// Note that the BDDs returned by [SymbolicSpaceContext] are not directly compatible with
/// [crate::symbolic_async_graph::SymbolicAsyncGraph], because they use a different [SymbolicContext]. However, you can
/// create a [crate::symbolic_async_graph::SymbolicAsyncGraph] that is compatible with the [SymbolicSpaceContext] by
/// using the [SymbolicContext] available in [SymbolicSpaceContext::inner_context]
/// (see also [crate::symbolic_async_graph::SymbolicAsyncGraph::with_space_context]).
