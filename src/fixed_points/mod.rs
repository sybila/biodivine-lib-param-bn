//! This module contains algorithms and data structures for efficiently computing fixed-points
//! of large Boolean networks.
//!
//! There are two main approaches one can use to obtain the fixed-points:
//!
//! 1. A solver based method (relying on Z3). This method works well for enumerating
//!     small batches of fixed-points, but does not scale very well for high numbers
//!     of fixed-points, as each of them has to be explicitly returned by the solver.
//!
//! 2. A symbolic BDD-based method. This approach generally suffers more from the state space
//!     explosion (it can take a long time for large networks), but if the number of results
//!     if very high, it can still outperform enumeration based on solvers. Also, it can be
//!     easily restricted to arbitrary symbolic sets,

    /// a particular subset of states. Furthermore, you can use `size_limit` to give the algorithm
    /// a hint as to how large (in terms of BDD nodes) you want the resulting sets to be.
    /// This value depends on how much memory and time you have, but a good starting value
    /// tends to be somewhere between `1_000_000` and `10_000_000`. If you'd rather want more
    /// smaller sets, but get them quickly, you can go as low as `10_000` or `100_000` (given
    /// the model is not too large).
    ///
    /// It is not strictly guaranteed that the results are within this size limit, but the
    /// algorithm makes a reasonable effort to achieve this.
    ///
    /// **Characteristics:** The algorithm is based on `Self::symbolic`, but once the expected
    /// size of the result exceeds the given `size_limit`, it will try to fork the computation
    /// based on one of the constraint clauses into two branches that can be completed
    /// independently. As long as there are still clauses to fork on, this should result in
    /// sets that are within the given size limit.
    ///
    /// Note that computing the result like this is almost always slower than just using
    /// `Self::symbolic`. However, there are possible advantages to this approach:
    ///
    /// 1. Depending on the chosen `size_limit`, the algorithm might use less memory to
    ///     compute the result than `Self::symbolic` (assuming you actually free the yielded
    ///     results or store them outside of the main memory).
    ///
    /// 2. While the runtime of the whole algorithm is typically longer, it should usually
    ///     take less time to get the *first* item than fully running `Self::symbolic`. Also,
    ///     you can often "tune" this time-to-first-answer using the `size_limit`, as smaller
    ///     results tend to be faster to find (iterating over all of them is longer though).
    ///
    /// Furthermore, it is relatively easy to extend this implementation to incorporate even
    /// more parallelism than in `Self::symbolic`. Also, we could decrease memory
    /// usage by storing some of the intermediate results on disk instead of RAM.
    ///
    /// Finally, note that there is a certain minimal value of `size_limit` below which the
    /// algorithm cannot really fork effectively, because the sets are simply too large for the
    /// limit. For truly large networks (>1000 nodes), it is not always a good idea to set the
    /// limit too low. If you only want to find *some* fixed point for *some* parametrisation,
